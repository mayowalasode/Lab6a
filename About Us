		<h1><b>Mayowa Lasode </b></h1>
		<p>
	      I’m a 2nd year Master of Applied Geography (GIScience) Student at the Geography Department, 
        Texas State University. I received my Bachelor of Science in Geography from Nigeria, where 
        I’m originally from. My interests are in natural hazards, geovisualization, vulnerable populations 
        and transportation geography. I’m currently working on a multi-criteria allocation 
        model of flood-evacuation shelters in Austin, TX.
